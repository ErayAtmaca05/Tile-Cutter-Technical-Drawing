# 🧱 Tile Breaker (SolidWorks Project)

This project is a **mechanical design study** created with **SolidWorks**.  
The "Tile Breaker" mechanism is modeled to simulate the structural and motion behavior of a tile-breaking system.  

---

## 📌 Project Overview
- Designed in **SolidWorks 2023** (compatible with newer versions).  
- Includes **part files (.SLDPRT)**, **assembly file (.SLDASM)** and **drawing file (.SLDDRW)**.  
- Demonstrates the use of:
  - **Assemblies** with mates
  - **Motion study / simulation**
  - **Exploded views** for presentation
  - **Material assignment** and **rendering**
